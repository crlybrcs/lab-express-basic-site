      <h2>Behavior</h2>
      <p>
        Flamingos are social birds that live in colonies. Colony life helps the
        birds establish nesting sites, avoid predators, and find food
        efficiently. The birds commonly stand on one leg and tuck the other leg
        beneath their bodies. The reason for this behavior is unclear, but it
        may help the birds conserve body heat or energy required for standing
        long periods of time. Flamingos are excellent fliers. Captive birds have
        their wings clipped to prevent escape.

      <h2>Reproduction and Offspring</h2>
      <p>
        Flamingos are largely monogamous and lay a single egg each year. Both
        males and females perform ritual courtship displays, sometimes resulting
        in same-sex pairs. A mating pair builds a nest together and shares
        incubation duties about a month until the chick hatches. Newborn chicks
        are fluffy and gray, with black feet and straight black beaks. Both
        parents produce pink crop milk to feed the chick. As the chick grows,
        the parents regurgitate food to feed their offspring. When chicks are
        two weeks old, they congregate in groups or cr√®ches, making them less
        vulnerable to predators. The chick turns pink within the first year or
        two and its beak curves as it matures. Wild flamingos live 20 to 30
        years, but captive birds can live much longer. One captive greater
        flamingo named "Greater" lived at least 83 years.
